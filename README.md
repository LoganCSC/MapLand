# MapLand

A native android app that allows you to compete with others to acquire geographic territories.

This application makes use of the map capabilities in the Google Play SDK. It stores user and location data in Google dataStore in the cloud using backend endpoints running in Google appEngine.

## To Build

1. Install the latest version of Android Studio and the google play SDK. See https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/
2. (optional) To run the backend component, you will need authorization via a private key (p12 file). You can get this key through your appEngine account. If you are just working on the front end component, you do not need this.
